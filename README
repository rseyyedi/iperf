iperf_zynq_7000

Description
===========

The iperf is an open source program, used as a network testing tool that can create TCP and UDP data streams and measure the throughput of a network that is carrying them.

This project explains how to compile, run,  and test iperf on your Zynq-7000 board linux.

You can download iperf from: http://iperf.sourceforge.net/
(The iperf version included in this project is: "iperf 2.0.5")


Installation
============

1. You need to have the "ARM GNU Tools" installed on your machine. you can find it from Xilinx website under: http://wiki.xilinx.com/zynq-tools

2. Use the following command to add the tools to the Linux host path and setup the environment vaiable in a Bash shell
	(at the time of writing I was using "xilinx-2011.09-50-arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi" version of GNU tool)
	
	bach> export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-
	bash> export PATH=<path>/CodeSourcery/2011.09/lin/Sourcery_CodeBench_Lite/bin:$PATH

Depending on the version of CodeBench tools you are using, the install path may be different than that above.

	bash> export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-
	bash> export PATH=<path>/CodeSourcery/Sourcery_CodeBench_Lite_for_Xilinx_GNU_Linux/bin:$PATH


2. Run the ./setVaiable to set up compilers variables

3. cd iperf-2.0.5

4. Start the iperf configuration for zynq-7000 by running:

	bash> ./configure --build=arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi --host=armv7-xilinx-linux-gnueabi


5. then compile iperf tool statically
	bash> make CFLAGS=-static CXXFLAGS=-static


6. you can find your cross-copiled version of iperf executable binary in iperf-2.0.5/src/ folder.


Troubleshooting
===============

If an undefined reference to 'rpl_malloc' problem occurs during the compilation process you can do the following:

	$ export ac_cv_func_malloc_0_nonnull=yes

Note: Preferable to start a clean build after setting up this variable to avoid further errors.
